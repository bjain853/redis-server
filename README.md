# Redis DB Server

This is an attempt to create a Redis Server which can interact with existing Redis Clients because it can understand Redis' RESP protocol and have some commands built-in which match those present in Redis. 

Current set of commands include SET, GET, HSET, HGET. More features will be added on an ongoing basis.

Inspiration for the project is from the articles created by GitHub user ahmedash95 [Link to project](https://github.com/ahmedash95/build-redis-from-scratch).
